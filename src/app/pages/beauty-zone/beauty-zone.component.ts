      Have you spent too much money and hours trying to get the desired look and finally got exhausted and unsatisfied from the result?
      
      Meet BeautyZone.`,
      userResearch: `The first part of the project was to conduct interviews with people from the beauty world, both content creator
      and content consumer. It allowed me to understand their needs and desires in order to identify the pain points
      they encounter.
      I learned from the interviews that in order to learn and discover the best products and techniques
      independently, they mainly use free platform such as Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube. If they wish to level up
      their makeup skills to become professionals, they have to sign up for paid courses.
      Sadly, It takes a long way to practice makeup or even just to master makeup as a hobby.`,
      colors: `The color pink, is thought to be a calming color associated with love, kindness, femininity, thoughtful and
      caring. Thats why I chose it to be my primary color - to empower woman and boost giving and receiving.
      Black is associated with power, strength, elegance, sophistication, and that is exactly what I want my app to
      represent.`,
      wireframes: `Once I was satisfied with the architecuture, I started to \n work on the user interface itself. 
      I started with a low \n fidelty sketch to understand what works and what \n doesnâ€™t work, 
      and then jumped and created more \n detailed and accurate prototype that can be tested.`,
      marketResearch: `After understanding the users needs, I made a competitor and market research to see how other products tackled this problem or similar ones. 
      I have explored many types of apps, from makeup apps to social medias such as instagram and pinterest, explored beauty e-commerce websites and apps with camera search.`,
